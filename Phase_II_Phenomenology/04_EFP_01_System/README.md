# EFP-01: Emotional Fluid Processor

**Status:** Rev. 2 (Operational with ERS)  
**System Type:** Fluid Dynamics / Cognitive Regulation Framework  
**Format:** Obsidian-ready Markdown

## 🌊 Overview

The **Emotional Fluid Processor (EFP-01)** is a systems-engineering framework for modeling, regulating, and integrating human emotional experience.

Instead of treating emotions as abstract or purely psychological phenomena, EFP-01 models them as a **non-Newtonian, viscoelastic working fluid** within a closed-loop system. This approach allows for the application of fluid dynamics principles—pressure, turbulence, shear stress, and residence time—to the management of internal states.

This repository contains the engineering specifications, operating procedures, and failure mode analyses required to run the EFP-01 system effectively. **This module functions as the regulation layer for the creative and theoretical work found elsewhere in this repository.**

## 📂 Repository Contents

This system is designed to be dropped directly into a Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) vault (e.g., Obsidian).

* **[EFP-01 - Emotional Fluid Processor (Hub).md](Phase_II_Phenomenology/04_EFP_01_System/efp-01-system-hub.md)** The central engineering design brief. Includes:
    * **P&ID Specs:** Plant layout (Heart/Mind/Body reservoirs) and instrumentation tags.
    * **Rheology:** Definitions of the working fluid (yield stress, thixotropy).
    * **Control Logic:** PID loops for Arousal (Pressure) and Expression (Flow).
    
* **[EFP-01 - Operating Procedure.md](efp-01-operating-procedure.md)** The standard operating manual (SOP).
    * Startup and Shutdown sequences.
    * Handling "High Turbulence" (recursive thought loops) and "Cavitation" (panic/shutdown).
    * Maintenance schedules for system hygiene.

* **[EFP-01 - Solution Document.md](Phase_II_Phenomenology/04_EFP_01_System/02_Research/efp-01-solution-document.md)** The "Expression Rerouting Subsystem" (ERS) and applied metaphorical mappings.
    * Details the routing of excess pressure to specific **Expression Ports (XP)**: Speech, Writing, Music, and Movement.
    * Provides debugging steps for specific emotional failure modes.

## ⚙️ System Architecture

The EFP-01 operates on a few core axioms derived from process engineering:

1.  **Viscoelasticity:** Emotional fluid remembers its history (hysteresis). "Processing" is the act of managing this viscosity over time.
2.  **Conservation of Mass:** Input must equal Output + Accumulation. Repressing flow increases system pressure ($P$) until the relief valve ($SRV$) lifts.
3.  **Laminar vs. Turbulent Flow:** The goal is not to stop the flow, but to keep the Reynolds number ($Re$) low enough to maintain laminar integration.

## 🛠 Usage

### Installation (Obsidian)
1.  Clone this repo or download the `.md` files.
2.  Drop the files into your Obsidian vault.
3.  Ensure you have a folder structure that supports the internal linking (or update links to match your vault).

### Usage as a Mental Model
The system uses P&ID (Piping and Instrumentation Diagram) tags as shorthand for self-regulation:
* **PT-101 (Pressure Transmitter):** Are you high-pressure? (Anxious/Angry)
* **CV-203 (Recirculation Valve):** Do you need to recirculate this thought before speaking?
* **DA-101 (De-aerator):** Are there "micro-bubbles" (intrusive thoughts) that need to be grounded out?
