# Phase I: Physics (The Source Code)

**Focus:** Lattice Gauge Theory, Emergent Gravity, Discrete Exterior Calculus.

This directory contains the foundational physics of the **Field of Consciousness (FoC)**. We posit that the vacuum is not empty, but a discrete **Isotropic Octahedral Lattice**.

## 📂 Structure
* **[/01_Paper](01_Paper):** The formal pre-print: *"The Field of Consciousness: A Lattice Gauge Model of Emergent Mass and Time"*.
* **[/02_Research](02_Research):** Notes on the **Ontological Intention Tensor**, **Geometric Tax** ($\kappa_{scale}=1/2$), and the **Triple-Well Potential**.
* **[/03_Code](03_Code):** Python/C++ simulations of the "Validation Trifecta":
    1.  1D PDE Domain Formation.
    2.  2D Lattice Confinement (Creutz Ratios).
    3.  Quantum Link Flux Flips.

## 🔑 Key Concepts
* **The Geometric Tax:** The $8\pi$ coupling of gravity emerges from mapping the discrete octahedron to a continuous sphere.
* **Intention as Stress:** "Intention" is modeled physically as geometric stress ($T^{\mu\nu}_{global}$), not mystical force.
