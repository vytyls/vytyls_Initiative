# Phase IV: Causality (The Firewall)

**Focus:** Recursive Geometry, Kerr-AdS Spacetime, Chronology Protection.

If consciousness is recursive (capable of self-observation), it creates loops. In physics, loops in time (**Closed Timelike Curves** or CTCs) typically break causality. Phase IV proposes a geometric solution to this paradox.

We demonstrate that the FoC protects global causality not by forbidding recursion, but by **quarantining** it within mesoscopic spacetime bubbles.

## 📂 Structure
* **[/01_paper](01_Paper)**: `foc-paper-4-causal-lamination-outline.md` — The master outline for the "Recursive Geometries" paper.
* **[/02_research](02_Research)**:
    * `kerr-junction-containment-v2.md`: Derivation of the **Israel Junction Conditions** for the containment shell.
    * `semi-dirac-boundary-condition.md`: The "Causal Diode" mechanism.
    * `ads-kerr-holographic-transducer.md`: The bulk-boundary dictionary for recursive depth.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. Laminated Causality
**"Causality isn’t broken—it’s laminated."**
We model recursive moments (déjà vu, precognition) as **Kerr-de Sitter Bubbles**. Inside the bubble, time loops; outside, it flows linearly. The boundary shell prevents the paradox from leaking.

### 2. The Semi-Dirac Shell (The Diode)
The containment boundary is composed of **Semi-Dirac Fermions**—quasiparticles that are massless in one direction (Radial) but massive in the other (Tangential).
* **Radial ($k_r$):** Transparent to "Intention" (Depth).
* **Tangential ($k_\theta$):** Opaque to "Consequences" (Spread).
This acts as a **Causal Diode**, allowing us to feel the future without breaking the present.

### 3. Entropy as Exhaust
The **Angular Momentum Flux ($j$)** of the shell is interpreted as the "informational exhaust" of the recursion. We experience this physically as **Entropy** and phenomenologically as the "Crackle" or noise of high-intensity events.
