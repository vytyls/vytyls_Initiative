## **Field Case Log (FCL)**

_Quick-capture form for synchronicities, anomalies, symbolic echoes, and crosspoints. Data auto-feeds for review + mapping. No personal information is collected._ 
*Indicates required question

### **Participant / Data Subjective**

_Name of participant. To add name, select "Other"._ 

- [ ] Vytyls

- [ ] Syence

- [ ] Lative

- [ ] Anonymous

- [ ] Other:

### **Location**

_A particular place or position, optional._

Your answer: 

### **FCL Entry Type***

_Select all categories that apply to this entry._ _Use “**Synchronicity**” for meaningful coincidences,_ _“**Anomaly**” for irregular or disruptive events,_ _“**Impression**” for personal or internal phenomena,_ _“**Symbolic Convergence**” for clustered or layered symbolic events,_ _and “**Recursion**” for repeating patterns or self-referential loops across time, context, or perception._ _Choose “**Other**” if the entry does not clearly fit these types._

- [ ] Synchronicity

- [ ] Anomaly

- [ ] Impression

- [ ] Symbolic Convergence

- [ ] Recursion

- [ ] Other:

### **Event Description***

_Concise summary of the event, anomaly, impression, or symbolic convergence._

Your answer: 

### **Environmental Context**

_Check all that apply. Describe any relevant physical, emotional, atmospheric, or situational details below if needed._

- [ ] Indoors

- [ ] Outdoors

- [ ] Alone

- [ ] With others

- [ ] Calm

- [ ] Tense

- [ ] Transitional (Travel/Movement)

- [ ] Other:

### **Modal Layer Field Map (MLFM)**

_Select observed layers or transformations. Check all that apply._

- [ ] Somatic Layer (L1): Raw sensory perception; bodily awareness; first-line environmental interfacing.

- [ ] Cognitive Layer (L2): Mental processing, internal monologue, memory recall, identity structures, narrative cohesion.

- [ ] Symbolic Layer (L3): Symbol-based cognition, dream logic, archetypes, metaphor-chains, pattern emergence.

- [ ] Synchronic Layer (L4): Cross-layer bridges; synchronicities, meaning-cascades, time slips, inter-event communication.

- [ ] Extra-Perceptual Layer (L5): Non-ordinary communication; connect with “The Extra,” high-weirdness, Stationary Sentience Fields.

- [ ] Interference Layer (Lx): Overlay/veil state; distortions that interfere with clarity of perception across tiers.

### **MLFM Notes / Lx Subsets**

_Lx subsets—Transitional Flow Field (Lx1), Indoctrinated Tether Field (Lx2), Recursive Interference Shell (Lx3)—are nonlinear, intermodal, and are often triggered or accessed through transitional states, cognitive dissonance, symbolic thresholds, or entheogenic modalities._ 

Your answer: 

### **Symbolic Echo Set (SES) Markers**

_Select relevant symbolic markers. Check all that apply._

- [ ] Phrase Repetition

- [ ] Image Convergence

- [ ] Numerical Recurrence

- [ ] Synchronistic Dialogue

- [ ] Memory Activation

- [ ] Pattern Recurrence

- [ ] Other:

### **Crosspoint Marker (CPM) Indicators**

_Indicate notable convergence across modalities or domains. Check all that apply._

- [ ] Modal Layer Shift

- [ ] Personal Narrative Tie-In

- [ ] Framework Resonance

- [ ] Collaborative Synchrony

- [ ] Intuitive Certainty

- [ ] Repeating Motif

Other:

### **Interpretive Notes**

_Initial framing, hypotheses, or uncertainties related to the event._

Your answer: 

### **Follow-ups / Actions**

_Planned next steps, cross-references, or tags for follow-up._

Your answer: 

### **Notes / Reflections**

_Final comments, tone shifts, or mnemonic signatures to preserve._
