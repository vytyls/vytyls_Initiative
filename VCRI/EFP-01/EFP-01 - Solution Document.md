# *Applications of Emotional Fluid Processor – Technical & Metaphorical*

---

## Purpose
To provide situational strategies for applying the Emotional Fluid Processor (EFP-01), bridging technical operation with experiential, metaphorical practice.

---

## 1. High Pressure (Overwhelm)

**Technical Application:**  
- Monitor PIC-301 for rising pressure.  
- Throttle VLV-101 (reduce cognitive intake).  
- Route excess through OV-601 (overflow) to prevent rupture.  

**Metaphorical Application:**  
- When emotions surge faster than you can process:  
  - Limit “taking on more” (pause incoming stimuli).  
  - Offload safely: talk with a trusted person, write, play music.  
  - Remember: overflow ≠ failure, it’s a designed safety system.

## 2. High Turbulence (Recursive Loops)

**Technical Application:**  
- TC-401 flags turbulence.  
- Adjust VLV-101 to slow flow into Mind reservoir.  
- Divert partial flow to SM-003 for storage and later processing.  

**Metaphorical Application:**  
- When thought spirals tighten:  
  - Reduce the speed of analysis (step back, breathe).  
  - Place some feelings “in the body” through movement or grounding.  
  - Allow time separation; turbulence settles if flow slows.

## 3. Low Flow (Suppression or Numbness)

**Technical Application:**  
- FIC-201 detects insufficient flow.  
- Stimulate EM-001 output (emotional core activation).  
- Temporarily bypass through OV-601 if reservoirs are stagnant.  

**Metaphorical Application:**  
- When you feel shut down or flat:  
  - Activate Heart through music, art, memory, or connection.  
  - Engage body (walk, stretch, breathe deeply).  
  - Even small drips matter — flow restarts gradually.  

---

## 4. Integration Mode

**Technical Application:**  
- Balance VLV-101 and VLV-102 for steady, laminar flow.  
- Maintain equilibrium between reservoirs.  

**Metaphorical Application:**  
- When flow feels balanced:  
  - Allow full circulation between heart, mind, and body.  
  - Savor coherence: expression matches inner state.  
  - This is optimal operation; take note for future calibration.

## 5. Emergency Override

**Technical Application:**  
- If multiple alarms trip, engage full Bypass: EM-001 → OV-601.  
- Reset valves to baseline.  
- Reestablish controlled flow before resuming operation.  

**Metaphorical Application:**  
- When everything feels like too much:  
  - Stop normal processing.  
  - Release energy directly (crying, movement, music).  
  - Do not force integration; focus on safety and reset first.
