# *Emotional Fluid Processor – Human System*

---

## 1. Purpose
To maintain continuous and balanced flow of emotional fluids across Heart, Mind, and Body reservoirs, ensuring safe integration and preventing recursive turbulence.

---

## 2. System Overview
The Emotional Fluid Processor (EFP-01) regulates three primary reservoirs:  

- **Heart (EM-001):** Emotional Core, source of raw affective energy.  
- **Mind (CG-002):** Cognitive Processor, regulator of flow and meaning-making.  
- **Body (SM-003):** Somatic Store, buffer for unresolved or embodied emotions.  

Flow is governed by valve-like regulators and monitored for turbulence.

## 3. Normal Operation
- **Flow Path:**  
  EM-001 → [VLV-101] → CG-002 → [VLV-102] → SM-003  
- **Setpoints:**  
  - Flow (FIC-201): Maintain smooth, laminar conditions.  
  - Pressure (PIC-301): Keep within tolerance to avoid rupture.  
  - Turbulence (TC-401): Detect onset of recursive eddies.  

- **Valves:**  
  - **VLV-101 (Cognitive Regulation):** Adjusts how much raw emotion enters thought.  
  - **VLV-102 (Integration Control):** Governs release of processed experience to body.  

---

## 4. Alarms and Safeties
- **High Pressure (PIC-301-HI):** Risk of overwhelm → initiate overflow.  
- **High Turbulence (TC-401-HI):** Recursive loop detected → reduce VLV-101 throughput.  
- **Low Flow (FIC-201-LO):** Suppression detected → manually stimulate EM-001 output.  

---

## 5. Emergency Procedures
- **Overflow Path (OV-601):** Route excess to Safe Outlet (art, conversation, movement).  
- **Manual Reset:** Temporarily close VLV-101 and VLV-102, breathe, and reestablish baseline.  
- **Bypass Mode:** Direct EM-001 to OV-601 if reservoirs are saturated.  

---

## 6. Notes
- Emotional fluid is highly reactive: temperature, context, and density affect integration.  
- Regular maintenance includes reflection, dialogue, and embodied practices.  
- Proper balance yields coherent expression and prevents buildup in any reservoir.
