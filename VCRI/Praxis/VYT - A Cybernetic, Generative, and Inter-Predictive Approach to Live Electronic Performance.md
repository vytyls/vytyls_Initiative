**Abstract**  
VYTYLS is a live electronic performance system composed of two performers operating interlinked generative, stochastic, and sample-based sound systems. Instead of relying on fixed compositions or deterministic sequences, the duo constructs bounded sonic environments defined by shared tuning systems, probability-driven rhythmic engines, and real-time modulation. Performance unfolds through mutual predictive synchronization between performers and autonomous algorithmic behavior within the machines. This paper formalizes VYTYLS as a cybernetic musical organism in which human intention, machine indeterminacy, and symbolic memory are mutually co-regulative.

## 1. Introduction: From Composition to Condition-Setting

Traditional electronic music performance is structured around:

- precomposed sequences
    
- rigid temporal grids
    
- recallable preset states
    

VYTYLS departs from this paradigm by shifting the compositional unit from **the song** to **the condition-field**. Rather than authoring fixed musical artifacts, the duo establishes:

- shared tuning constraints
    
- generative rhythmic ecosystems
    
- modular sample transformation systems
    
- real-time mutation interfaces
    

Music emerges as a consequence of interaction within these fields rather than execution of predetermined forms.

## 2. Distributed System Architecture

### 2.1 Lative: Generative Rhythm and Harmonic Field Control

The primary sound-generation system is built in **Native Instruments Reaktor** and consists of:

- A **12-oscillator drone synth** driven by envelope-sequenced permutations
    
- A **monophonic modal/atonal synth** tuned to non-standard pitch systems
    
- Two drum engines:
    
    - An **8-oscillator synthetic drum machine** driven by Conway’s _Game of Life_ cellular automaton
        
    - A **sample-based drum machine** with dual timing logic:
        
        - fixed 3/4 or 4/4 anchors
            
        - and variable-length 1–16 step syncopation regions
            

All rhythmic, tonal, and sample elements are **retuned to a shared tritonic harmonic field**, ensuring that rhythm itself participates in harmonic structure rather than existing as an extrinsic grid.

Control is mediated through a **Behringer BCR2000**, which functions not as a traditional controller but as a:

- stochastic state mutator
    
- pattern-seeding interface
    
- probability modulation surface
    
- real-time structural rewriter
    

Pattern mutation, system silencing, density modulation, and generative reseeding occur continuously throughout performance.

### 2.2 Syence: Sample Deformation and Temporal Memory Systems

Syence operates a **custom multi-module Max/MSP sample mangling system** responsible for:

- real-time granular deformation
    
- loop destabilization
    
- envelope convolution
    
- temporal freezing and reanimation
    

Input material includes:

- environmental recordings
    
- prior VYTYLS performances
    
- recorded conversations
    
- archival audio and found sound
    

All processed signals are routed through **analog guitar pedals** (tremolo, reverb, compression), forcing digitally transformed memory into physically resonant acoustic behavior.

Additionally, Syence performs on a **Novation Ultranova** configured for:

- envelope-driven timbral identity
    
- contour-based synthesis behaviors
    
- sound design driven by modulation topology rather than oscillator purity

## 3. Shared Tuning as a Cybernetic Constraint

A defining feature of VYTYLS is the adoption of a **shared tritonic tuning field** for all instruments, samples, and percussive elements. This serves several functions:

1. **Harmonic Coherence Under Indeterminacy**  
    Even when rhythm and texture behave chaotically, the pitch field remains gravitationally unified.
    
2. **Perceptual Binding Across Systems**  
    The audience perceives structurally related sound even when surface behavior is unstable.
    
3. **Modal Elasticity Without Tonal Resolution**  
    The tritonic base allows motion without traditional cadential closure, producing a persistent state of harmonic suspension.

## 4. Generativity, Autonomy, and Controlled Entropy

The system operates at three simultaneous control layers:

|Layer|Function|
|---|---|
|Human Intent|Pattern selection, muting, modulation|
|Machine Autonomy|Conway-based evolution, random reseeding|
|Environmental Feedback|Room acoustics, crowd response|

This creates **bounded entropy**:

- The system is never fully deterministic
    
- The system is never fully chaotic
    

Emergence is therefore:

> statistically constrained, but experientially unpredictable.

## 5. Mutual Predictive Synchronization Between Performers

One of the most structurally significant elements of VYTYLS performance is the phenomenon of **anticipatory inter-performer alignment**. During live performance:

- When one performer removes a structural layer, the other often supplies material in the same moment
    
- These behaviors are not choreographed
    
- They arise from prolonged shared system familiarity and embodied predictive modeling
    

This constitutes a form of:

> **distributed pre-conscious musical cognition**

The result is that audience members experience:

- intentionality without explicit signaling
    
- coherence without precomposition
    
- responsiveness without hierarchy

## 6. Symbolic Memory as Sound Material

Because Syence’s system routinely reincorporates:

- past performances
    
- recorded conversations
    
- archival sonic fragments
    

VYTYLS operates as a **recursive memory ecology**. Past states of the duo reappear as transformed sonic agents within new performances. Memory therefore becomes:

- non-linear
    
- deformable
    
- performable
    

Rather than referencing nostalgia, the system enacts:

> **temporal self-interrogation through sound.**

## 7. Emotional Consequences of Structural Design

The emotional character commonly reported by listeners—unease, beauty, suspension, drift, disorientation—arises not from aesthetic intent alone, but from **structural properties**:

- Modal ambiguity
    
- Non-cadential harmonic motion
    
- Autonomous rhythmic mutation
    
- Sample-based memory deformation
    
- Absence of predictable form
    

Importantly, these qualities emerge as **system byproducts**, not as stylistic targets.

## 8. Classification: What VYTYLS Is (and Is Not)

VYTYLS is not accurately described as:

- experimental dance music
    
- ambient electronica
    
- live techno
    
- generative installation art
    

It is more precisely defined as:

> **a dual-human, multi-machine, cybernetic improvisational organism operating within harmonic, probabilistic, and memory-based constraint fields.**

---

## 9. Conclusion

VYTYLS demonstrates that:

- generative systems need not eliminate human meaning
    
- indeterminacy can coexist with emotional coherence
    
- algorithmic behavior can function as an expressive partner rather than a compositional threat
    

The duo’s work stands as a model for **post-linear performance practice**, where sound is no longer authored moment-to-moment, but _cultivated as a living field of possibility_.
