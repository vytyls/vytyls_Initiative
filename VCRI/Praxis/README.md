# PRAXIS: The Cybernetic Performance Archive

> **"Theory without application is hallucination. We test the Field in the room."**

## 📡 Archive Overview
This directory houses the longitudinal performance data of **VYTYLS** (Lative & Syence). Unlike traditional electronic music performance, our praxis is defined as **"Cybernetic Acoustic Research"**—live, improvisational stress-testing of the *Field of Consciousness (FoC)* framework against audience feedback loops.

## 🗂️ Chronological Indices (Grant Verification)
