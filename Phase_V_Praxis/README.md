# Phase V: Praxis (The Engine Room)

**Focus:** Live Performance, Acoustic Ecology, Visual Aesthetics.

This is where the theory hits the ground. **VYTYLS** is the cybernetic organism that demonstrates the theory in real-time.

## 📂 Structure
* **[/01_Theory](01_Theory):** Cybernetic performance protocols ("Mutual Predictive Synchronization") and System Architecture.
* **[/02_Field_Labs](02_Field_Labs):** Performance logs and artifacts from live instantiations (VYT-001, etc.).
* **[/03_Project_Norway](03_Project_Norway):** Proposal for **Fjord Systems**, utilizing the **Ancestral Geodesic** as a data collection methodology.
* **[/04_Visual_Aesthetic_Lexicon](04_Visual_Aesthetic_Lexicon):** Datamosh scripts and the "Glitch Ontology" (e.g., Rift Constructs, Fractal Veins).

## 🔑 Key Concepts
* **Tritonic Tuning:** All systems are bound to a shared harmonic field.
* **Generative Translation:** Environmental sound (Norway) is treated as behavioral input, not just texture.
